1,"Pretty big Casino. I visited the Sentosa casino a couple of years ago, decided to try MBS this time. Overall both Casinos are almost same. Enjoyed a few games and surprisingly I won a (small) amount. Walked out with my money in my pocket and smile on my face.There are a lot of slot machines but I was surprised by the lack of diversity in the slot games available, Casino should invest in a few simple slot games for beginners to enjoy. Free soft drinks for patrons.Casinos are good for a bit of fun but don't go in expecting to make money, I just had a bit of luck, that's all. Casinos are huge revenue generating machines for their hotels... Singapore Casinos make >$3 billion a year. Obviously they don't make this money by giving it away to tourists :) Play a bit, expect to lose, and then walk out.",2018-09-23,"New Delhi, India",bubble_40,DrVineetGGupta,Couple

There are three restaurants and can eat, but price was different from Singapore dollar payment and Bay Sands Point (?) Payment, price was different, if Singapore dollar was paid, it was somewhat expensive, but the taste was delicious. It is necessary to describe the address, telephone number, DP number, but I could also make it like a point card (member card?).

7,"After reading the procedures of getting in and the dress code requirements we decided to take a look whilst at the SkyPark. I know it reads no shorts but thats rubbish as I asked the security guard and he said it was no problem, I saw many people with shorts on.Entry is a bit difficult, having to show passports. Thinking that Singapore was anti smoking, it was a shame to find the place full of people puffing away. They do have a no smoking section but you walk out of there stinking of stale smoke.There are NO ATM's inside the casino, so you have to go back through security, yes correct, through security just to get out!There was free stations for soft drinks and hot drinks, did not see any alcohol. They have these cool looking robots that are stocked with bottles of water than you can walk up to and take a bottle.Lots of slots machines and table games.

15,"We have visited and stayed at the Marina Bay a couple times over the years. One thing we noticed every time we went to casino service got worse, long ques, stupid security check making you feel as if you were a criminal, toilet smelling foul as if it wasn’t cleaned all day and worse of all the slot machines just take your money no payouts at all. We went spent 1500$, 100$ on each machine playing midrange bet and walked out without a single cent in winnings. We must have played on at least 13-14 machines and none even opened a free play or bonus, thus showing us machines are rigged to take and not even give player a chance in getting any money. This kills the fun and with the rude security staff on your way in and out it all adds up to don’t bother going as the house will win anyway and leave you with less money to enjoy on other nice places in Singapore. No entertainment, no free alcohol, and no feeling that you are in a real international casino. Don’t bother going!",2018-02-20,Yangon ,bubble_10,goran s,Couple

In the casino you get free coffee and water etc. However, there is no alcohol. There are various games such as slot cards, roulette etc. I did not notice the last time, there was a dealer who sticks Hinomaru to the nameplate of the dealer.

However, to get into the casino, you must queue for a security check which includes showing your passport so they can scan it for information. Why a casino needs your passport to enter is beyond me.

WARNING for all foreigners, you MUST have your passport on you to enter this casino and to exit it also.Smoking is fully allowed at Marina Bay Sands so be prepared for a VERY smoky atmosphere. Real downside I did find was lack of restaurants unless you want to navigate the security to go out of the casino.

53,"Marina Bay Casino is very good and kind to visitors. Let me explain.1. Easy access: by mass rail transit. Clean.fast efficient at Bayfront Station. Or Take Taxi.2. Luggage: leave at counter at casino entrance. Free. However, no plastic bag of food.3. Passport: foreigners must bring passport. Singaporeans must pay Sing $100 for 24 hours. Strict. Check for authencity. Will fine you if you use fake I.D.4. Two Floors: lower floor, smoking. Can be quite bad for your clothes and lungs. Do not understand why they ban smoking in all indoors in buildings in Singapore, but here they chain smoke. If you sit next to smoker, good luck yo your lungs. Second floor: smoke free area, but less tables and slot machines about the same.5. All kinds of table games: baccarat, 5 card poker, 3 card poker, Texas holder, black jack, etc. Also localized poker games. Crap. Slot machines: 2 cents, 5, 10 and 20 cents. Fafafa slot machines most popular, with tai Sai or big small. Many Bangladeshi, Indians and locals play this.6. Higher floors: restricted entry, higher stake table games and 50 cents and $1 slots. Higher denomination for higher grade players.7. Lucky draws on weekends and public holidays.8. Have noted that foreign visitors have good luck:- a Mr Singh won more than S$70,000 on slots- a Taiwanese won $25,000 on 3-card poker- baccarat players are big winners9. Note that once win you should stop. Have witnessed those who won $10,000 or more lose all as they continue playing slot machines.10. Drinks: cold and hot drinks freely available, Beer free at premium play areas. 11. Food is most reasonable in restaurants in casino. No children allowed.I wish they have smoking room or areas in Bay Casino like in Casinos in Macau. The players and workers therefore have clean environment and safer medical health clean air. In the long term, some worker or long term visitor will sue the government for allowing smoke induced illness like lung cancer. I like the Macau arrangement where smokers are controlled in smoking rooms.

Although I experienced the casino for the first time, I was surprised at the size. Also drinks are free. People who want to play table games with interpersonal guys because the minimum is about $ 100, I think the threshold is high for those who are just experienced like me. Also, because roulette is European, I abandoned it because the sequence of figures was different from what I know. As a result, we went to slot machines called Takifuku.

Smoke is not troublesome, even on lower floor. There is a large variety of games, but oddly lacking in any video poker. The casino has only 2 craps tables, and no ""bubble"" craps machines. There are plenty of Sic Bo tables and Bubble Sic Bo machines, which is an Asian game similar to Craps. Plenty of Black Jack, and poker variations (though oddly not much Pai Gao). Table limits for most games, including craps were S$25. Slot machines can be found all the way down to 2 cents. No free alcohol drinks that I saw, but plenty of free coffees, teas, waters, sodas, including several self-serve coffee/latte/espresso machines and soda fountains.

The North South line terminates at Marina Bay station, which is a 10 minute walk away. If using North South MRT line, better to transfer at Promenade Station to Circle line.

145,"We took note of another Trip Advisor's comments as to which of Singapore's two casinos is better. They stated this one had a no smoking section which meant to us that the other one did not, ie all smoking. Not true. This one, the Marina Bay Sands Casino has a lower level smoking area that has basically no ceiling and the smoke goes straight up to the entry level area. The air con was effective however and you didn't really notice the smoke from above. Instead of walking into a brightly lit, fun looking venue, you face a blank wall and have to choose to walk left or right, not knowing where either direction will lead you. The entry level mezanine is the outer circle of the casino which overlooks the smoking tables below. We didn't bother venturing down there but it looked like it was just tables. The entry level had limited machines and variations of games. The odds overall were not as good as they are in Perth, WA. They areas for changing foreign currency and cashing in chips are separated therefore the majority of the guests, being foreigners who do not have to pay the $100 entry fee like the residents do, have to find and line up at 2 separate desks. The one and only Information desk was not manned in the hour we were there and nobody comes when you push the ""call for service"" button. Signage everywhere (nowhere) was lacking and inappropriately placed. All cool drinks are free and dining is very limited. Definitely not as good as the casino on Santosa Island.",2015-06-17,"Perth, Australia",bubble_30,Marilyn R,Couple

The first guy was at least somewhat friendly and courteous but the second officer was a total donkey's behind. He kept giving us this look like a couple of Orientals like us couldn't possibly be holders of US passports and we must be locals trying to pull a fast one. Very unwelcoming to say the least! Seriously, I think we got through the immigration checkpoint at Changi airport faster than at this place. At eleven, the place was hopping with plenty of gamblers but also people just sitting there gawking at passers-by. Must be already tapped out or just there to watch the action; take advantage of the free sodas; or to enjoy the free cigarettes (floating in the air). Very poorly ventilated for a place that allows open smoking. The stench of cigarettes smoke makes it quite unbearable. Ambience and décor was quite disappointing considering the absolutely magnificent resort hotel it is housed in. For some reason we expected more, much more.In retrospect, it kind of confirmed our suspicions that they really were cutting corners and trying build on the cheap after the SANDS ran into financial trouble during construction and had to be rescued by the Singapore government. We think the luxury casinos in Vegas i.e. Bellagio, Venetian are way way better in all aspects. Needless to say, we did not stay to indulge. If asked, we can say we were there. That's about it.

While searching a bit, I looked for a small roulette of money and I calmly sit back so as not to be swallowed by a scary atmosphere. As I got no hands, I was swept away around 100 dollars to keep changing, but I was very frightened when I saw the bill being swallowed in the table.

202,Not sure if it's their rule or Singapore government rule but you must have a passport to get in. They charge $100 if you don't have one or if you are a Singapore citizen. So you walk up give them your passport they look at it move you forward where you have to give it to someone else who scans it then you finally get it. The cage is right by the entrance so if you need to exchange money its pretty easy to do. They have free coffee and soft drink stations everywhere but they do not have any alcohol at least I could not find any anywhere. The casino was quite large lots of table games and slot machines on the first level. Going down a level there is lots more table games. I believe there is probably more tables games here than any casino in Vegas. The place was packed so they must be doing something right. As we were leaving we had to have our passports scanned again. Not that big of a deal but had we not been prepared would have been annoying to come over just to have to leave again to go get the passport.,2014-04-01,"Melbourne, Australia",bubble_30,john262702,Couple

Note that there are upper levels for non-smokers. Not so much to see if you are not into gambling.Complimentary water bottles, soda and coffee served in disposable mugs. It kind of resonated what Marina Bay Sands hotel and surrounding mall is all about: a playground for wealthy and wannabe rich people who cannot afford to stay in the hotel.

They do have card tables and the place seemed relatively quiet. Sadly not much can be said for the clientele, dropped a winning gaming voucher while watching the girlfriend play an electronic gaming machine, was $65 and the indian playing next door to us must have quickly picked it up as it hit the floor as no one else was near us where we were playing and I recalled him bobbing down to pick up something but initially though nothing of it, OH Well so much for honesty :-( At least in Australia there is more likely chance of someone making you aware you have dropped something and handing it to you.I certainly wouldn't make a bee line for the Casino unless you are a keen Gambler and want to punt while you are in Singapore. otherwise there are plenty of other enjoyable things to do.",2014-03-06,"Wodonga, Australia",bubble_30,Goldfinger100,Couple

Anyway that's the way it was.Upon entry the casino was nothing flash - large open gaming floors lacking atmosphere or pazazz. We had a couple of drinks (not cheap) and checked the place out. Indoor smoking was off putting and poker machine selection appeared limited. There are also no ATM's within the casino so if you realise you need some more money you need to exit the casino to find an ATM and then repeat the whole entry process once again. Very frustrating and offputting - either take enough cash in with you or be prepared to be mucked around if you want to donate more money to the casino.Overall an unremarkable experience - would not be in any rush to return in the future.",2014-01-06,"Mona Vale, Australia",bubble_20,Alex C,Couple
215,"It was easier to get into Singapore than to get into this crappy casino. The immigration at the airport only looked through your passport once but this casino had to check your passport at least 3 times. They checked your passport from front to back, and all the stamps from all the countries you had visited prior and to make sure all the “i”s were dotted and “t”s were crossed. And obviously all the guards who work there also work in prison. How else can you explain their rudeness? They had me checked my backpack before I stood in line and I had to open the bag under the camera for inspection. Make sure I didn’t have any illegal underwear stashed inside. The women behind the counter were an unpleasant bunch. I guess they must be from another country because everyone I met in Singapore so far had been nice and helpful. Once inside there were rows and rows of Baccarat tables and not many of other table games. No sure what attracted the people there because locals have to pay 100 dollars to get in. That was the first time I had ever heard of a casino charging an admission. That’s more expensive than Disney World except no cartoon character was going to come out to hug you and take a picture. Table minimum was 25 dollars plus. People were betting hundreds of dollars in one hand for no apparent reason. We looked around and didn’t see James Bond so we left.

216,"1) You need to cloak your backpack and camera before trying to enter the casino. The staff behind the cloak room were unfriendly. Do not dare to ask them a question.2) You need to have your Passport on you to gain entry. Why? Locals have to pay a S$100 charge to enter the casino. The security guards checking the passports are rude individuals who treat each visitor as though they are attempting something illegal. Becareful as they go through your passport that your immigration card does not fall out. The guards do not seem to care if you lose the card or not. The queue's can be quite long.3) Smoking is allowed everywhere within the casino. Sitting on either side of me at the Rapid Roulette machine were two heavy smokers. I lasted less than 2 minutes. Smokers are at the pokers machines, tables, drink machines and even rest rooms.4) Free water and soft drinks throughout the casino at certain spots.5) Very crowded overall. The casino is immense, but the crowds were even bigger. People bumping into you.6) No where to sit and observe. Therefore people were sitting at poker machines to take a breath, or rest or people watch.7) You need to show your passport on exit. Again the security guards treat you as though you have something to hide and go through your passport - page by page - for no apparent reason.

Upon informing me that all Foreigners were required to produce a passport to enter the casino, he immediately shuffled us out of the queue as if we were being evicted for some wrong doing. I have now read an explanation for the passport requirement, something about locals needing to pay $100 for entry (an attempt to prevent locals becoming addicted to gambling! Really?

The difference between the Marina Bay Sands and Las Vegas casinos is that there are many more table games and fewer slot machines. There are also two floors instead of the single floor design of most Las Vegas casinos. We had to check in our day pack at a holding area (but not my wife's smaller purse) and show our passports twice before entering. I was also told to either take off my baseball cap or wear it backwards for security purposes. These security measures are a hassle and thankfully absent in Las Vegas.

However, when we went inside, it appeared to us that people were smoking anywhere they wished. We could only stand about five minutes and left without buying a single chip. My conclusion: this casino is a good place for smokers, and if you go inside, you will become a smoker without ever lighting up a cigarette.",2012-08-25,"Miami, Florida",bubble_30,Iconoclast526,Couple
253,"I was in Singapore with my boyfriend to celebrate our anniversary. We had a wonderful week. It looks like a city, casino shops (then we love the game), courtesy, but the most exciting part was that of the pool: WONDERFUL. We had Singapore at our feet. We spent a little but it was worth it.",2012-08-25,corsico,bubble_50,Chiara G,Couple

256,"We visited the Casino last week while staying at the Marina Mandarin Hotel. Had heard so much about the Casino so we went armed with our passports.Casino is free for non nationals. You stand in a line that says Foreigners!. 2 security check points to get in where they swipe your passports. Not very welcoming or friendly. Like security at the airport. Inside we were met with silence. No atmosphere. Nothing. No laughing. Atmosphere was like an exam center. Couldn't believe it. We have been to Las Vegas and California so had thought it would be something similar. Hardly any Europeans visible. No bars, only coffee and water. We walked around and noticed there are no manual roulette wheels, they are all automated. very strange. We ate at a noodle bar which was very nice and they served beer. On the tables were cards for Gambling Addiction services. We then walked around again hoping that the evening would improve. It didn't so we left without gambling at all.We then discovered talking to a local friend that Singaporeans take gambling very very seriously. So that would possibly explain the silence. People were also allowed to smoke inside this building which is beautiful but really allowing smoking in this day and age ?So all in all, very very disappointing. Would not recommend it at all. Felt like we were subjected to unfriendly staff at security on the way in. Surely they should be welcoming and trying to encourage people to visit ? This was the only occasion in Singapore in 9 days that we came across such a welcome.",2012-07-16,"Dublin, Ireland",bubble_20,scarke,Couple

261,"This is a well maintained casino. The atmosphere though was more formal than I expected. When I play table games, I enjoy interacting with the other players and dealer. I found many of the tables to be quiet and serious, maybe because the table minimums are high. ",2012-05-11,"Raleigh, North Carolina",bubble_40,Kat0425,Couple
262,"Night, the first experience of the casino. A two-story, extensive grounds are full of slots, roulette, baccarat and other game machines. The attitude of the staff who checks entrance is soft. Aiming at Beginners rack, it contributes the minimum amount to the slot, but ends without knowing the rules. The strange feeling was that in a slot of about 10 aircraft, surely, like a drawstring bag, a poorly grown aunt who was tired of living a couple of lines, as many as a few rows, on the pedestal I threw out the feet of the soup stock and push the button of the slot bluntly. Singaporeans are quite expensive to enter, so few people come here. Foreigners are free, so there seems to be a tour across the border. Are you OK? These women. I wonder if it is gamble holic? I got empathy and it was not fun at all.",2012-03-17,Nara,bubble_10,sakuratomimoza,Couple
263,The casino was very smelly from the cigarette smoke in the air. There were designated smokers areas but no one took notice. Not that it mattered anyway because the smoke would have traveled throughout the whole casino regardless. I couldn't stay for more than an hour. Make sure you bring your passport because its free for tourists. Locals have to pay a fee.

265,"useful information for the players: as in all Asian casinos most of the tables are dedicated to bacarat (or punto banco), then there are some blackjack or pontoon version and then many sic-bo tables, nice game with the dice much appreciated. Finally there are a few roulette tables. the minimum bets are typically 25sgd on red and black or similar and 5sgd on numbers, there are also tables with a higher minimum. They have recently introduced other roulette with minimum on simple options to 10sgd but they are double zero !! around there are coffee machines and other drinks for free, but do not offer anything to eat but there are two restaurants always open. However, as in all casinos you almost always lose :-)))",2012-01-07,"Bari, Italy",bubble_40,angelo888,Couple
266,"Ensure that if you are traveling from outside of Singapore that you bring your Passport as entry will be refused without one. Once inside the place is massive. A huge selection of tables, aimed more towards the Chinese market which I would expect. Very few tables of Blackjack, Poker etc. All around the outside of the tables are hundreds of slots machines. The casino continues onto a smaller 2nd floor which looks over the ground floor. There are a few places to grab food and soft drinks, water and tea/coffee are all free. The waiters will either deliver or you can get a drink from one of the many drinks stands located around the casino. My only concerns were just how busy the place is. It can be difficult to get a seat at a table and don't be expecting small limits. $25SGD a hand, minimum. I also found it struggled with smokers. Being an ex-smoker I actually enjoy the smell, but it can get too much. We tended to move to the 2nd floor for a break as it's less busy/smokey.",2011-12-23,"Sheffield, United Kingdom",bubble_30,Mowzertron,Couple

When one attends a show put on at a Casino with profile of MBS you expect to find a standard similar to that you would find in Las Vegas expecially for $130 dollars. I am talking about something comaparable to Jersey Boys. Unfortunately Abba Mania was excruciatingly bad and not worthy of stage time at the Casino. The standard was of that you would expect to find in a suburban hotel or a rock eisteddfod. We went with 2 other couples and we all left at the interval. It's a little sad that MBS could be so mercencary with events like this I felt robbed of $115 as this show was only worth $15 max.

When you visit this grand location you have to pay $20:00 singapore to go to the top to see the views. ( out of this world )... But be aware that if you make a booking to do the tour ( which is only for the first 50 in the Que ) and it rains and the tour is cancelled then you don't get your money back. But that aside do the trip to the top without being in a tour as you will be sorry if you don't.Then there is the shopping in the magnificent shopping plaza's. Four floors including a skating ring, a lake and river with a Gondola, Restaurants, and every High End shop name that you could think of is there.Make an effort because when you leave there you can go across the harbor on a water taxi and get on the Singapore Flyer as well.",2011-10-16,"Melbourne, Australia",bubble_50,cullodenmist,Couple

I was kept waiting for a long time while she kept looking at the screen while other visitors in the other lane were moving swiftly. Finally, after waiting for a long time, I asked her what was the issue? She rudely told me that the system is still checking my passport. And, I am denied entry. So I suggested if I could go to the next lane? She rudely told me that is the same system, even if I were to change lanes. I was so upset at her rudeness that I was thinking of leaving. But I told her that this was my first visit to the MBS Casino. And suddenly she gestured to another sullen male staff and she started talking in Malay to him (thinking that I did not understand! How rude is that?). After talking, the rude staff returned my passport and gestured to me to enter, like she is some US Secret Service operative. SO RUDE!
